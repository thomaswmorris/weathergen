Weathergen
==========

``weathergen`` generates time-varying weather profiles for different locations on Earth, allowing for the simulation frameworks like `maria <https://github.com/thomaswmorris/maria>`_ to simulate climatologically-accurate ground-based astronomical observations. But there are probably other reasons to simulate weather, too. 

Parameters
-----------

``weathergen`` simulates the following weather parameters:

Usage
-----

Install the package using pip:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    pip install weathergen
       
In Python, import the package and pass a site and an array of times to the ``generate`` function. For example, to simulate weather for Princeton, New Jersey between June 1st and September 1st at a resolution of a minute we would write 

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from datetime import datetime
    import weathergen

    t0 = datetime(2022,6,1).timestamp()
    t1 = datetime(2022,9,1).timestamp()

    gen_times = np.arange(t0, t1, 60)

    weather = weathergen.generate(site='princeton', time=gen_times)

Note that the supplied year is arbitrary: the underlying model considers only annual and diurnal climatological variations. The supported sites are listed below, and are also stored in ``weathergen.sites``. Specified times should be supplied in Unix time.

The weather parameters are contained in the attributes of the ``weather`` object, e.g. ``weather.air_temp`` or ``weather.pressure``. The values are typically two-dimensional with shape ``(n_times, n_heights)``, where ``weather.time`` and ``weather.height`` describe the time and height of each dimension, in Unix time and meters above sea level. Single-level parameters are described by a single number for each time and do not have a layer dimension. 


Sites
-----

Supported sites are outlined below. Sites are included for the presence of major astronomical observatories, or because they are climatological outliers (and thus a good test of my model).
