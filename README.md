# Overview

```weathergen``` generates a time-varying vertical profile of weather parameters, specifiying the temperature, pressure, cloud coverage, and wind vector for a set of heights above the ground. 

## Methodology

Using ERA5 reanalysis data

## Sites

Supported sites are shown below. Sites are chosen for the presence of astronomical observatories, or because I think that they're climatologically interesting.
